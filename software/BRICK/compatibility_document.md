# BAND SDK v0.1 Community Policy Compatibility for BRICK


> This document summarizes the efforts of current and future BAND member
> packages to achieve compatibility with the BAND SDK community policies.
> Additional details on the BAND SDK are available
> [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bandframework/bandframework/main/resources/sdkpolicies/bandsdk.md)
> and should be considered when filling out this form. The most recent copy of
> this template exists
> [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bandframework/bandframework/main/resources/sdkpolicies/template.md).
>
> This file should filled out and placed in the directory in the `bandframework`
> repository representing the software name appended by `bandsdk`.  For example,
> if you have a software `foo`, the compatibility file should be named
> `foobandsdk.md` and placed in the directory housing the software in the
> `bandframework` repository. No open source code can be included without this
> file.
>
> All code included in this repository will be open source.  If a piece of code
> does not contain a open-source LICENSE file as mentioned in the requirements
> below, then it will be automatically licensed as described in the LICENSE file
> in the root directory of the bandframework repository.
>
> Please provide information on your compatibility status for each mandatory
> policy and, if possible, also for recommended policies. If you are not
> compatible, state what is lacking and what are your plans on how to achieve
> compliance. For current BAND SDK packages: If you were not fully compatible at
> some point, please describe the steps you undertook to fulfill the policy.
> This information will be helpful for future BAND member packages.

**Description:**  BRICK is a Python layer to the $R$-matrix code AZURE2. It
allows the user to easily sample what it typically optimized in an $R$-matrix
calculation. What is included here is a basic tutorial to familiarize BRICK
users with its most important features.

### Mandatory Policies

**BAND SDK**
| # | Policy                 |Support| Notes                   |
|---|-----------------------|-------|-------------------------|
| 1. | Support BAND community GNU Autoconf, CMake, or other build options. | Full | BRICK relies on the PyPA `build` package. |
| 2. | Provide a comprehensive test suite for correctness of installation verification. | Full | Basic functionality tests can be found in `tests/12Cpg` |
| 3. | Provide a documented, reliable way to contact the development team. |Full| In addition to the contact information above, BRICK is hosted on GitHub where the development team welcomes feedback and contributions from the community through issues and pull requests, respectively. |
| 4. | Come with an open-source license |Full| Uses MIT License. |
| 5. | Provide a runtime API to return the current version number of the software. |Full| The `brick` module has a `__version__` attribute that returns the version number as a string. |
| 6. | Provide a BAND team-accessible repository. |Full| [https://github.com/odell/brick](https://github.com/odell/brick) |
| 7. | Must allow installing, building, and linking against an outside copy of all imported software that is externally developed and maintained. | Full | |
| 8. | Have no hardwired print or IO statements that cannot be turned off. |Full| BRICK's main class, `AZR`, has a `verbose` attribute that can be set to `False` to silence all print statements. |
