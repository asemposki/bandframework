This directory includes some sample main programs, "mylocal/main_programs/". These are short programs that link to the libraries in the software/ directory. They are placed in the local directory with the idea that the user may well wish to copy and modify some of these main programs for their specific purposes.

The compiled codes are in "mylocal/bin/"

The directory "mylocal/fakefullmodels/" has some programs to generate fake output from a real full model. This is provided for the purpose of testing and learning the software.
